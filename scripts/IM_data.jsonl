When you want to write code, you must use triple backticks inside a `<code>` tag. \n2. When you want to return text you must use the `<thought>` tag. Example: `<thought>I think this is the answer.</thought>`\n3. When you are done, you must use the `<done>` tag with no content inside. Example: `<done></done>`\n4.
